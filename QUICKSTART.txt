# Hairsnip Archive Viewer (2021-11-01.1) #

This webapp is meant to browse and display archives of the body of stories once shared between the domains: hairsnip.com, 1hss.com, and haircuttingstories.com, as recorded in an SQLite 3 format.

## How to Use ##

To use the webapp, you will need a modern web browser with support for HTML5, asm.js, and the set of features included by ECMAScript 6 (Which was released in 2015, as the most recent of these three hard dependencies.).

Open `hairsnip-viewer.html` in your supported browser, then use the file selection labeled 'Select SQLite File' to choose `data.sqlite`. The page may become unresponsive during loading, but will list the time required to load `data.sqlite` upon success, or a message to notify you of failure.
